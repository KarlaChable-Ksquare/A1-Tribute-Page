    <h3>Who Was Queen Elizabeth II?</h3>
    <p>Queen Elizabeth II became queen on February 6, 1952, and was crowned on June 2, 1953. She was the mother of
      Prince
      Charles, heir to the throne, as well as the grandmother of Princes William and Harry. As the longest-serving
      monarch in
      British history, she tried to make her reign more modern and sensitive to a changing public while maintaining
      traditions
      associated with the crown.</p>
    <p>Elizabeth died on September 8, 2022, at age 96.</p>

    <section id="tribute-info">
      <ul>
        <li>Queen Elizabeth II was born Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary on April 21, 1926, in London, to Prince
          Albert, Duke of
          York (later known as King George VI), and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.</li>
        <li>Elizabeth was crowned Queen Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, in Westminster Abbey, at the age of 25.</li>
        <li>Elizabeth married her distant cousin Philip Mountbatten (a surname adopted from his mother's side) on
          November 20, 1947,
          at London's Westminster Abbey.</li>
        <li>Elizabeth and Philip wasted no time in producing an heir: Son Charles was born in 1948, the year after their
          wedding,
          and daughter Anne arrived in 1950. Elizabeth had two more children—sons Andrew and Edward—in 1960 and 1964,
          respectively.</li>
        <li>Elizabeth had 15 prime ministers placed into power during her reign, with queen and PM having a weekly,
          confidential
          meeting.</li>
        <li>For much of her life, the queen surrounded herself with dogs. She was especially known for her love of
          corgis, owning
          more than 30 descendants of the first corgi she received as a teenager, until the death of the final one,
          Willow, in
          2018.</li>
        <li>Not one for the spotlight, Elizabeth liked quiet pastimes. She enjoyed reading mysteries, working on
          crossword puzzles
          and, reportedly, even watching wrestling on television.</li>
      </ul>
